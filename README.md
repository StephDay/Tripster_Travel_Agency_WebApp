# Tripster_Travel_Agency_WebApp
This repository contains the code and resources for a failed attempt to create and build an integrated chatbot using Amazon Lex through AWS Console, Python code with PyCharm, Django Framework, and API using JSON to communicate between the chatbot and the web application.

**Approach**
The approach used was to follow the steps and guidelines provided in various online resources and AWS documentation. This involved creating appropriate intents, slots, and utterances in Amazon Lex, writing the web application using PyCharm and Django Framework, and attempting to create an API using JSON to communicate between the chatbot and the web application.

However, despite following the guidelines closely, the chatbot failed to be integrated. Various troubleshooting techniques such as using the sample GitHub code, and creating a snippet in CloudFormation stack in the personal AWS account were also tried, but to no avail.

**Testing**
Several rounds of testing were conducted to check the functionality of the chatbot. The chatbot was tested using the testing console within AWS, and via a deployed API endpoint. While the chatbot did work as expected being able to respond to various user inputs and carry out its intended functions, it was not able to be integrated into the webapp successfully.

**Lessons Learned**
Through this project, several lessons were learned:

Creating an integrated chatbot is a complex process that requires significant attention to detail and troubleshooting skills.
Following guidelines and documentation is important, but it is not always sufficient to ensure success.
Test-driven development can be a useful approach to help ensure the functionality of the chatbot.
Troubleshooting skills are crucial, and a willingness to try different approaches and methods is necessary to resolve issues.

**Future Work**
If attempting to create an integrated chatbot in the future, the following approaches would be considered:
Invest more time in researching and understanding the different components involved in creating an integrated chatbot.
Using test-driven development to ensure the functionality of the chatbot throughout the development process.
Explore alternative deployment methods, such as deploying in a different platform or using different code libraries and frameworks.

**Conclusion**
Although this integrated chatbot project was ultimately unsuccessful, it provided valuable insights into the process of creating an integrated chatbot and the importance of troubleshooting and testing throughout the development process. While the project did not meet its original goals, it still provides a useful resource for those seeking to understand the complexities of creating an integrated chatbot.
